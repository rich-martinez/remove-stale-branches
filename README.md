The tool was written using Node 10.10, NPM 6.1.4, and Git 2.18.0. Older versions of Node, NPM, and Git may work but they have not yet been tested.

## Installation

```
npm i -g remove-stale-branches
```

## Use
Run the `rsb` (i.e. Remove Stale Branches) command from the repository that you wish to remove stale branches from.

### Example
```
cd /path/to/repository && rsb
```
